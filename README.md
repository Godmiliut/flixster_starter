### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics covered throughout the week were fundamental for the completion of this project. By introducing us to the structure and syntax of HTML and its collaborative behavior with CSS and JavaScript, we counted with the basics in order to accomplish the core features. Moreover, the implementation of the stretch features are more than possible with the help of a little research and peer or instructor assistance in the case of getting suck.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had have more time, I would have definitely worked on implementing the embedding video feature, I believe it completes the general idea of this project and serves to earn additional skills. Additionally, I would have touched up the css component of my project in order to make it more personal and unique.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went pretty smoothly in general, the instructors and peers provided a really welcoming enviroment which gave way to constructive feedback and the sharing of different approaches.
